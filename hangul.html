            <h3>Korean Consonants</h3>
            <img src="images/alphabet.jpg" alt="korean Consonants">
            <P>In Korean, consonants have names that don’t correspond exactly to how they sound, just like we do in English. (W is pronounced “double-u,” for example, even though that’s not the sound the letter actually makes in words.) It’s probably most important at this stage for you to focus on the actual sounds, but I’ve included the letter names below too.</P>
            <br><p><span>There are a few mnemonic devices commonly used to teach some of the above:</span> <br><br>

                ㄱ is shaped like a gun.<br><br>
                ㄴ is shaped like a nose<br><br>
                
                ㅁ looks like a mouth, if you have a good imagination.<br><br>
                
                ㅂ looks like a bucket.<br><br>
                
                ㅎ could be a child’s drawing of someone wearing a hat.<br><br>
                
               <span>Here are some ways to remember the other letters:</span><br><br>
                
               
                ㄷ looks like a divining rod. I mean, sort of.<br><br>
                
                ㄹ is a winding road, though maybe not as long as the one in the Beatles song.<br><br>
                
                ㅅ looks like a wave in the sea about to crash on the shore.<br><br>
                
                ㅈ sort of looks like two car bumpers right up against each other, which might happen in a traffic jam.</p>

            <h3>Korean Vowels</h3>
            <img src="images/alphabet.jpg" alt="korean Consonants">
            <p>Vowels don’t have names that are distinct from their sounds. They’re just called what they sound like.<br><br>

                ㅏ (a) sounds like “ah”<br><br>
                
                ㅓ (eo) sounds like something between “oh” and “uh”<br><br>
                
                ㅗ (o) sounds like “oh,” but more rounded<br><br>
                
                ㅜ (u) sounds like “oo”<br><br>
                
                ㅡ (eu) sounds like “euh”<br><br>
                
                ㅣ (i) sounds like “ee”<br><br>
                
                Since these are all based around a horizontal or vertical line, they might be a bit easier than the consonants to remember right off the bat.</p>
